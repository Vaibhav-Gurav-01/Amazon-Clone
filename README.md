# Amazon-Clone
This project is a static web page clone of the popular e-commerce platform, Amazon. Built entirely using HTML and CSS, this clone replicates the user interface and design elements of Amazon's homepage. It serves as a demonstration of front-end development skills and an exercise in web design.
